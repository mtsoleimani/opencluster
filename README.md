OpenCluster is a Java framework designed to facilitate service registration, service discovery, clustering, and simple in-memory key-value storage. 
This service has been developed to fulfill the requirement of operating multiple instances of services in a cloud environment without the need for knowledge 
of their addresses or the addresses of other peers. All instances of OpenCluster form a cluster using the Gossip Protocol. There are plans to develop load balancing 
and API Gateway functionalities in the future.
